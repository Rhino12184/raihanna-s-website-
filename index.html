    <h2>about me </h2>

    <p>  I am interested in technology as a lot of jobs involve some form of tech even more so for the jobs in the future. being "tech-savvy" is a useful skill to have. weather your working for a company or starting your own business.
        </p>
    <ul> 
     <h3>tech within business</h3>
        <p>One of the biggest factors in making a business successful is being customer friendly. Having websites that allow the customer to get quick and easy informant about the business after working hours is a great way of doing this. Boosting sales with features like fast shipping. Have a website helps the business to create a larger public image for their target audience[1]</p>
        <p>Technology within a business can also save money and time. By using accounting software allowing most of the accounting process to be automatic. Good software for small to medium-sized businesses is QuickBooks. And companies are now able to hold a meeting online again saving time. Another cheap and easy way of business communication is slack allowing staff.</p>
        <p>HR also uses software and related hardware for automating the human resources function in a business. It includes employee payroll and compensation, management, workforce analytics, performance management, and benefits administration. making there jobs a whole lot easier. </p>
         
    <h3>what do you need to make projects successful
        and how should you plan it?
    </h3>
        <p>The first step in completing a project digital or not is to plan it out a good tool to do this on is trello. This is a project management tool and is a great way to organize your plan..trello can be used on an individual Project or when you’re working in a group.  You need to make sure you managing your time. Set deadlines.you will also need to know what tool is best suited for your brief, for example, when making a textbase game we learned that python was a good programming language to use. 
            </p>
        <h2>planing </h2>
        <p>when making trello board create a to-do, doing and done list that I will be able to tick off as I go along. I will look at other websites online for inspiration wireframe is a useful way of planning the content and planning the layout of the website before I start to code the webpage. Once I have planed the structure and can then use it as a plan that shows me exactly what needs coding where on the page. [2] 

                You may need to be refreshed on some parts of the plan-making online research a good idea. Just be wary of certain websites such as Wikipedia as the info might not be reliable </p>

    <h3>how your project could fail </h3>
       <p> Lack of Planning. If you start the project without understanding the scope and if the targets are unclear and everything is managed in a rushed way. It could higher your chances of failing the project. For example, if you do not plan out the layout for a website or theme for a text-based game before starting to code them it may be harder to structure it. another way your project might fail is not references your sources as it might look like your cheating </p>
        </h3>selecting

            And using IT systems and software </h3>   
         <p>
                Fundamentally, technology is a tool that helps you do what you do better, faster, or more efficiently, therefore, finding  Software most relevant to your project is the first step. for example, it wouldn’t make sense using https when designing a textbase game. to make sure you are using the best software for the job you should do a little research.</p>
            
        <h3>what Github is and what its used for   
            </h3>   
            
         <p>
                GitHub is a website and cloud-based service that helps you develop, store and manage your code, as well as track and control changes to your code. This will make the whole coding process easier, and more organized</p> 
            
         <h3>How does GDPR impact
                digital projects? 
                </h3>   
            

         <p>you could be fined if you don't follow the GDPR. you need to make sure you take over people's work and ask for permission.</p>
           
        <h3>content and layout</h3>
          <p>when creating my webpage am going to keep my layout in mind. the layout is important as it keeps users on the site because. a good layout should make important content easily accessible and essay to find. A bad layout will frustrate the users and they will quickly leave the site because they can’t find what they are looking for.
            </p>

        <h3>copyright and other constraints afecting websites</h3>
         <p>Copyright and other  property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you can publish. The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it.
            </p>
         <h3>issues that
                people with disabilities may face when using webpages  </h3>
          <p>
                there is a wide range of difficulties people may have when using webpages such as[3]</p>
            <li>Visual Impairment</li>
            <li>Hearing Impairment</li>
            <li> MotorSkills/Physical Disabilities</li>
        <p>many conditions affect cognitive ability, such as</p> 
            <li> dyslexia</li>
            <il>dementia.[3] </il>
            <h3>how wbsites can try to over come this </h3>
            <h4>Use alt tags.</h4>
            <p>When you hover your mouse over an image on a website, the little words that pop up are called alt tags. For someone who has a visual impairment and uses a screen reader (a software program that reads text on a website out loud), the alt tags are read aloud and are the only way a user knows what the image is.</p>
            <h4>your use of color</h4>
            <p>make sure you don't use garish colors like yellow, blue and green as this could make it difficult for someone color blind to use. black and white is also a safe option 

                           </p> 
            <h4>Know your audience.</h4>
            <p>something i have noticed whilst researching ways to make the website suitable for people with disability it may be impossible, to design generically for all disabilities. "Within the main categories of disability — sensory, physical and cognitive — there is such wide variation, so it's important to understand your users first and target audience.{4}</p> 

            <h4>appropriate filetypes for websites
                </h4>
                <p>they are different types of filetypes depending on what you need it for here are a few I have found 
                        HTML/ .HTM — Hypertext Markup Language file
                        Most pages you create for a website will be HTML files, like what we have used on this course.
                        .JPG/.JPEG — Joint Photographic Experts Group file
                        Another very common image file format, mainly used for photos.
                        CSS — Cascading StyleSheet
                        CSS files are a tool in the repertoire of webmasters that take care of how their websites look. again what we have looked out in class. </p>
                <h2>website review</h2>
                <h4>IT tools</h4>
                <p>
                        when making the website I used HTML, I liked this tool as it was straightforward forward
                        and I liked CCSS as you can see your changes on the websites as you go along making it easier to see what looks good. 
                        </p>
                <h4>Visual Studio Code</h4>
                <p>as a first time user, the studio code was 
                        productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, making it easier to use. i also found it easier writting code on a black background compared to when we used pyhon.
                       </p>
                  <h4>strengths and weaknesses of my
                        final project </h4>  
                 <p>I've put all my written content into HTML, using headers para and other features like list giving my website some suture. if I had more time I would like to go past this and create more then one page for my website. 
                        when using CSS I change the background color, font size, and color and changed the way the text was position on the page. if I had more time on CSS </p>
                    <h4> further improvements</h4>
                    <p>if I had more time on the project I would have used more CCSS on the website. for explaining a background image. also, I would have added another page for my website spreading out the written content. 
                        </p>
                        <h4>Review outcomes to make sure they match
                                requirements and are fit for the purpose</h4>
                        <p>
                                I followed the outcomes throwout the project using them  as a way to plan what I am doing . it help writing the outcomes out first so I had content for my webpage and a plan to go on trello </p>
                     <h4>he benefits and drawbacks of IT tools
                            and systems used in terms of productivity and
                            efficiency – could you have been more efficient
                            when making your website? How? Could you have
                            done it in teams?</h4>
                        <p>trello helped with productivity as is helped set out a clear path. you could make a website in teams. using a trello board to plan the project together and set out different tasks for the team, for example, one person writes the content another puts it into HTML and another style it, like how we planed the text-based game project. 
                            </p>
                            <h4> ways to improve productivity and
                                    efficiency</h4>
                            <p>it would have been great if we had  more time on the project so I could add more features to my website. </p>
                      <h4>solutions to improve own productivity
                            using IT in digital projects – what would you do
                            differently next time</h4>
                            <p>
                                it would be nice to work in teams to spread the different elements of the project. and use slack to share code with the team </p>
                   <h4>how you would go about testing
                        digital solutions </h4>
                        <p>I would swap work with someone to have a look at my code and websites just to check if there were any bugs in my code and do the same for them.</p>
